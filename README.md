# Cutils

A personal collection of reusable utilities and helper modules that I commonly use in C projects. The goal of this repository is to provide small, focused, and portable components that can be dropped into other codebases.

## Repository Structure

```bash
├── allocators/         # Custom memory allocators (TODO)
├── data_structures/    # Arrays, lists, hash maps, etc. (TODO)
├── math/               # Math helpers and utilities (TODO)
├── utils/              # Miscellaneous helpers (TODO)
└── tests/              # Tests (TODO)
```

Each folder typically contains `.h` files with the public APIs and `.c` files with the implementations.

## Overview

### Memory allocators (`allocators/`)

## Usage

Copy the specific `.c` and `.h` files you need into your project.

## Testing

Some modules may include small test files or usage examples, but this **repository is not test-driven** as a whole. You are encouraged to add tests when integrating modules into your own projects.
